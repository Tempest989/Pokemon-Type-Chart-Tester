# Pokemon Type Chart Tester
A quick, daily puzzle style tests made to help improve my knowledge of Pokemon type chart interactions and to test / improve my skills with using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Has only been tested to work on PC so I currently have no idea if it works properly on mobile devices.

## How to Use

- Follow the button prompts and instructions accordingly to play the game.
- The Types shown in the table can be dragged and dropped in different areas of the table to answer some questions.

## Improvements / What's Left?

- Currently no UI design features, so that needs to be done as soon as possible.
- Add in more obvious ways for the user to know how many points they got for their current answer.
- Add in a new mode that shows the answer type table for an inputted type combination, for easy confirmation of a type combinations interactions.

## Thanks for Reading and Enjoy!
